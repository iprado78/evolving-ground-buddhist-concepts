# "Emptiness" and Shravakana

As part of [Evolving Ground](evolvingground.org), we orient the start of Vajrayana practice around _shi-nè_, the first of the [Four Naljors of the Aro gTér](https://www.aroencyclopaedia.org/shared/text/n/naljors_ar_01_ncr_eng.php).

In practicing _shi-ne_, we're meant to be getting acquainted with emptiness:

> Shi-nè takes us to the experience of time without content--mind without mental events. The purpose of shi-nè is to facilitate an experience of Mind in which one discovers referencelessness. This is the realization of emptiness and the knowledge that thoughts or mental events are not in themselves the fabric of Mind. The nature of Mind is sheer brilliant emptiness.[^1]

As noted in several Evolving Ground discussions, "emptiness"/_sunyata_ is a word which has a long, contested history in Buddhism. There are semi-related meanings leading to semi-related ideas and practices. There are also semi-related words like "not-self"/_anatta_, "cessation"/_nibbana_, and "impermanence"/_anicca_ with contested relationships to "emptiness"/_sunyata_. These differences in meaning or interpretation can be used as a key to understanding the differences between different Buddhisms (and also understanding the roots of the endless misunderstandings and confusions among their advocates and practitioners). Each Buddhist school or vehicle could be understood as explicating a meaning of "emptiness" and elaborating the true Buddhism on its basis. The school of "Early Buddhis(ts/m)" could be designated, as I will explain, _Shravakana_, and it has a particular view of the meaning and functioning emptiness in the Buddhist path.

I very much like the Aro formulation, ["Buddhism is a religion of method, not truth"](http://ngakma-nordzin.blogspot.com/2011/07/teachers-vehicles-in-buddhism.html). It's one of the main reasons I joined Evolving Ground. While it certainly captures _something_ that's distinctive about Buddhism in the aggregate, it doesn't really reflect the central tendency of how Buddhists and Buddhisms have gone about their thinking and talking. It may be useful then to understand how Buddhists of other Buddhisms say things in their own words (including their meta-view on Buddhism as a religion of truth vs. method). This blog post, then, is about how some Early Buddhism oriented scholar-practitioners view emptiness, not-self, cessation, and their relationship. By "Early Buddhism oriented", I mean people who attempt to ground practice in the Pali canon and allegedly reconstruct what the historical Shakyamuni Buddha thought and taught. I'll also look at what Aro seems to take from the Early Buddhist perspective in its view/method with respect to _shi-nè_, and what it doesn't.

## Sutra to Tantra

Concretely, Aro, as a lineage of Nyingma Vajrayana, is concerned with the move from ["Sutra to Tantra"](https://www.patreon.com/posts/sutra-to-tantra-41355682) in the understanding of emptiness. Aro does the main breakdown of vehicles from the perspective of Dzogchen as "Sutra, Tantra, and Dzogchen", rather simply seeing Dzogchen as the highest tantra.

dual vs. non-dual understanding of emptiness
non-dual understanding of the dual and non-dual
]

One of the interesting things about "Sutra to Tantra" as I've encountered the phrase in my initial months of Vajrayana practice is that it's used in at least a couple of different ways:

1. A dynamic passage from Sutric view and method to Tantric view and method
2. A static gestalt switch from Sutric view and method to Tantric view and method

So, in an example of the dynamic use, Sutra is understood as the preliminary set of practices for Tantra. This means getting firmly rooted in an understanding of empty-mind and heart-mind. Empty-mind is the state of effortless, non-conceptual clarity that results from continuous non-engagement with whatever arises in experience. Heart-mind is the skillful compassionate spontaneity that results from continuous engagement with whatever arises. From the dynamic result of these practices adapted from pre-Tantric Buddhism, you achieve the base of the right experiential framework to begin the practices of energetic transformation that are the core novelty of Tantric view and method in a Buddhist context.

In an example of the static use of "Sutra to Tantra", Sutra is understood as the "causal" vehicle and Tantra as the "result" vehicle that land you in the same state of realization. The causal vehicle of Sutra works through purification. Right-view, right-speech, right-action, right-concentration, etc. progressively remove hindrances until the realized state is achieved and no "karmic traces" of the three poisons--greed, hatred, delusion--are left. Crucially, "progressively" can mean over many lifetimes. The result vehicle of Tantra works by going directly at getting acquainted with the realized state and letting it unfold, since it is always already there and available. Tantra is also called the "lightning" or "fast" vehicle because it's associated with believing you can reliably use it to achieve realization in one lifetime ("in this very mind and body"). There's still developmental transformation in the result vehicle, because there's a process of letting the realized state arise in personal thought and activity more and more. However, there's no sense of leaving behind anything other than your ignorance of what's always already been the case. Ignorance and unskillful behavior are not fundamentally distinguished.

## Shi-nè: Non-dualistic Sutrayana

What's interesting about _shi-nè_ as the method for realizing empty-mind is that it combines these two ways of understanding the move from "Sutra to Tantra". On the one hand, the practice "purifies" the mind of thought or mental events by "renunciation" or non-involvement with them as they arise. You are attempting to rest in emptiness. But you are also doing this--or letting the not-doing of it happen--non-dualistically and going straight to the result. You're letting the presence of awareness arise in the whole field of mind and attempting to rest in that empty space without fixing what arises in reference points. This would be the dimension of emptiness in the realized state that is synonymous with "Dzogchen" (though it has other dimensions).

The contrasting dualistic versions of Sutrayana practice would involve maintaining single-pointed concentration on an object of focus (_shamatha_) while remaining uninvolved with what's outside that focus. This is true even if the object of focus is an expansive["immaterial realm"](https://www.lionsroar.com/the-taste-of-liberation/). These are dualistic practices because there's a split between the act of observing and what's observed built in to the method.

_Shi-nè_, which is a direct translation of _shamatha_ into Tibetan, is non-dual. It's a practice of letting the presence of awareness show itself in the empty space of mind that is not fundamentally distinct from it ("sheer brilliant emptiness"). Note, however, "not fundamentally distinct" does not mean "simply identical with". Non-dual is both "not-two" and "not-one". Because _shi-nè_ is non-dual in this way, the base andd path of the 4 Naljors are hard to distinguish from the result. This is why the final meditation instruction to get acquainted with the base of Dzogchen--the realized state or the beginningless non-duality of emptiness and form--is by design not so different from the first instruction to get acquainted with result of Sutra (emptiness):

#### 1st Instruction

> Sit comfortably somewhere quiet. Sit with your eyelids comfortably almost drooping--almost closed, or partially open--just enough to let in a little light. [...] If thoughts come, let them come. If thoughts go, let them go. [...] Simply let go of whatever arises in your mind. Keep releasing your grasp on whatever you may have found yourself grasping. [...] Whatever happens, allow your mind to be as it is. [...] Attempt to remain alert, but without undue tension.[^2]

#### Final Instruction

> Sit comfortably with your eyes wide open. Remain alert but without tension.[^3]

_Shi-nè_ would be Dzogchen with the flavor of non-engagement or under the dimension of emptiness. This flavor of Dzogchen should not be understood as the full base of Dzogchen proper. Dzogchen proper involves spontaneous, authentic engagement with form as it arises _out of and with_ empty mind--_with your eyes wide open_.

### Shravaka: Dualistic Sutrayana

In conjunction with doing a lot of _shi-nè_, I am reading
Gyamtso Rinpoche's book of meditations on emptiness[^4]. It takes you through five stages:

> This book "Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness” presents the key stages in the Buddhist experience of the Absolute Truth of Emptiness as fivefold:
>
> 1. the Shravaka stage,
> 2. the Chittamatra stage,
> 3. the Svatantrika-Madhyamaka stage,
> 4. the Prasangika-Madhyamaka stage.
> 5. the Shentong or Great Madhyamaka stage.
>
> Although these stages are named after the Buddhist Schools that formulated them, in fact, they represent the stages in the development of an individual’s understanding of emptiness.[^5]

The first Shravaka stage, all I have gone through to this point, is meditation on "not-self":

> At this stage one does not consider the emptiness of all phenomena, but only the emptiness or not-self of the person. The importance of this is that it is the clinging to a false idea of a permanent, single and independent self that is the root cause of all one’s suffering. One does not need to have an explicit or clearly formulated idea of such a self in order to act as if one had one. ‘Self’ here means the implied self, which might also be regarded as implied in the behaviour of animals.[^6]

Not-self meditation provides a good entry point for comparing dualistic (Early Buddhist) vs. non-dualistic (Dzogchen) approaches to the Sutrayanic realization of emptiness.

Linguistically, the first stage corresponds to the first Nyingma yana, _Shravakana_. This will be a little confusing if you understand a _shravaka_ [as](https://www.spacious-passion.org/shared/text/s/spacious_passion_ch_02_skymind_03_vehicles_eng.php#_ftn10) someone who listens to teachers and reads teachings but doesn't practice. In the context of Early Buddhism, the _shravakas_ are the pious attendants of the Shakyamnui Buddha who heard his teaching on not-self and were immediately enlightened. Specifically, what they heard was the teaching of the five _skandhas_ and how they are empty of self. They _are_ not-self. This is the teaching of the not-self characteristic of phenomena, related in summary form in the [Second Discourse of the Buddha](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/wheel017.html#s2).

The key to "emptiness"/_sunyata_ in Early Buddhism is that it's almost always used in the _sunya_ form as an adjective (_x_ is empty of _y_), rather than as a noun for a free standing quality of emptiness.[^7]

For some Early Buddhist scholar-practitioners, it's important to focus on this because it leads to a better understanding of _anatta_ as "not-self" rather than "no-self":

> The anatta teaching is not a doctrine of no-self, but a not-self strategy for shedding suffering by letting go of its cause, leading to the highest, undying happiness.[^8]

"Not-self" is a method of detachment or non-identification with what arises in experience. In meditation, it's moment by moment observation of experience and recognizing it fundamentally and simultaneously _as what it is_ and _as not-self_. This is _vipassana_ or insight practice, the complement to _shamatha_ or concentration practice. It is monitoring, noting, and tunnelling fully into the experiential atoms of whatever arises, and it is grokking the relationship of particular mental events to their conditions of origin and cessation. And it is fundamentally dualistic because it is something observing, discriminating consciousness is doing with what is observed or discriminated.

In contrast to not-self, "no-self" would a metaphysical truth or view one attempts to actualize and hold onto in meditation practice by, say, becoming ["blank as a fart"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJbq1vWWd4E). This can become an object of clinging or attachment, the [spiritual materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_materialism#Lords_of_Materialism) dynamic that Chögyam Trungpa warned against. It can also lead to dissociated states or derealization. These are, perhaps, understood as what our teacher Charlie Awbery describes as the characteristic failure mode of Early Buddhism (that does not mean it doesn't have success modes).

In the context of not-self understood as a method, a non-Buddhist might wonder why detachment or non-identification with the five _skandhas_ would be necessary, let the alone the key to the "highest, undying happiness". The five _skandhas_ break down into:

1. Material Forms (all constituents of body and environment)
2. Affective Qualities (attraction, aversion, indifference)
3. Sensory Qualities (yellow, loudness, pitch, mustiness, saltiness)
4. Accumulated Dispositions (any tendency to act a certain way given a certain situation or stimulus)
5. Discriminating Awareness (seeing a sunshine, recognizing a face, hearing a burglar)

There are a lot of legitimate questions to ask about why one would segregate phenomena into these five baskets rather than some other categorization scheme. At first glance, if we're treating not-self as method, those questions might matter slightly less. Presumably the import of the method would apply whatever categorization scheme we choose. It would apply because the reasons the Buddha gives for recognizing the five _skandhas_ as not-self in the Second Discourse are perfectly general:

1. They are not subject to control
2. They are impermanent

[

- complete identification vs complete transcendence from what arises
- in dealing with the fifth skandha, not-self will naturally bleed into no-self
