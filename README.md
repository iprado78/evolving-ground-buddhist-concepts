# Evolving Ground and Buddhist Concepts
These are blog posts contextualizing Vajrayana practice as part of the [Evolving Ground community](evolvingground.org) with related concepts from Buddhist history.  I am new to Vajrayana practice.  I know enough about Buddhist history to be dangerous.  Comments and suggested edits welcome.
