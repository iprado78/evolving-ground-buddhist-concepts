# Evolving Ground and Buddhist Concepts

These are blog posts contextualizing Vajrayana practice as part of the [Evolving Ground](evolvingground.org) community with related concepts from Buddhist history. I am new to Vajrayana practice. I know enough about Buddhist history to get myself in trouble. Comments and suggested edits welcome.
